## Introduction

IN THIS NOTEBOOK/PROJECT WE WILL ANALYSE THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS BASED VARIOUS FEATURES SUCH AS GENDER , PARENT'S BACKGROUND AND STATUS OF TEST PREPARATIONS

WE WILL ANALYSE EACH COLUMN WITH THE HELP OF VISULAIZATIONS

#### WHAT WE WILL DO?

WE WILL ANALYSE WHICH GENDER IS PERFORMED BETTER
CAN WE PRESUME STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE BASED ON HIS/HER RACE OR ETHNICITY?
DOES PARENT'S EDUCATION BACKGROUND MATTERS?
DOES STANDARD OF LUNCH MAKE DIFFERENCE IN STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE?
WILL STUDENT PERFORM GOOD IS HE PREPARED FOR THE EXAM OR NOT? AND VICE VERSA

## DATASET 

GENDER : Gender of students

PARENTAL LEVEL OF EDUCATION : Background of parent's education

LUNCH : Standard of lunch

### I have also deployed the model in this project using Flask, html and CSS as a wzb app which will give us student's Statut (Succeed Or Not Succeed)
